      "Brandon Zick, the CIO of Ceres Partners, manages a $1.4 billion fund that invests in farmland. He grew up on a dairy farm in Pennsylvania before working on Wall Street for over a decade. He discusses the demand and supply dynamics, the economics of farming, and the criteria for investing in farms. Zick emphasizes the value and optionality of owning land and dispels the misconception of consolidated land ownership in the U.S. He also highlights the low institutional ownership of farmland.\n",
      "The majority of land ownership in the US is held by non-farming heirs, estates, and trusts, with a robust rental market for farmland. Farmland is actively operated by family farms, and there is a trend of consolidation as generations move away from farming. Institutional investors have started to enter the farmland market, but the diverse ownership group makes it difficult for a large-scale roll-up of assets. The turnover of farmland ownership is low, and it will take generations for significant changes to occur in the ownership landscape.\n",
      "Ceres, an investment company, has been around for 30 years and only 3% of farmland is institutionally owned in the US. In other parts of the world, institutions can deploy capital more easily due to different property rights. Land transactions are primarily done through private transactions and public auctions, with private transactions being the larger part of the market. Ceres uses farm tenants to source deal flow and believes in investing in the US due to limited availability of farmland for sale.\n"
